# Point and Click game Engine & Editor

A simple tool to create and play point and click games.

### Features (planned/wip):

* World/Game state, different variables which can be used as conditions
* One resolution for the whole game
* Scenes which have one background image
  * Clickable areas per scene
    * On mouse hover the mouse icon may change
    * They can forward to other scenes, they may change the world state
      * The action can be different depending on the world state
    * They can be enabled/disabled automatically depending on the world state
  * Images may be drawn on a Scene
    * They can be visible/invisible depending on the world state
* There is an inventory
  * The inventory behaves as list of "items"
  * Items may be attatched to the cursor when "picked up" (from inventory)
  * Clickable areas can have items attatched to the cursor as condition
* Transition effects

### Not planned yet:
* Videos/Animations (Examples: Intro/Outro, Door/Lever switch), Item position on scene)
* Sounds/Atmo/Music

### Motivation:
We used to draw point and click games on paper, with this we can make them to real point and click games

There are plenty old games which are no longer updated/supported, these games can be ported to this game. Watch out for copyright ;)
